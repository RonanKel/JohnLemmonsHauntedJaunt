Dot Product: Ronan Kelly

I used dot products to make the gargoyles face you as you move around. This is mostly seen in the flashlight movement.

Sound Effects and Triggers: Ronan Kelly

I added a shower sound effect so the shower now makes a noise when you're near it. Additionally, When you walk through the door to the bathroom, 
the ghost in the shower will begin to hum a tune. This was done by making an audio object located on the ghost, attaching a Box Collider positioned in the correct place
that triggers the humming audio when entered for the first time.

Both sound effects were sourced from pixabay for free. Here are the sound effects:
